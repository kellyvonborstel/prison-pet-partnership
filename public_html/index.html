        <p>Though our public programs are not currently operating, we are so grateful that we are able to continue to support our community inside and outside the prison walls. This year PPP was able to support two recently released women from the program with full scholarships for grooming kits. They are now both gainfully employed, housed and loving life on the outside! Additionally, we were able to award a previously incarcerated woman from the program with a full scholarship to attend UW’s Animal Behavior program to enhance her impactful street outreach work with the City of Olympia. PPP has also placed two service dogs this year, Team Leah & Angelou and Team Tobin & Austen to our 2021 Service Dog Team Graduate roster. PPP is on track to support two more releasing women and place up to three more service dog teams by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Your continued support means so much to us!</p>

        <h3>Important Announcement from the Board President</h3>
        <p>Dear Friends of PPP,</p> 

        <p>Throughout the pandemic, our work paused to support WCCW as they focused all efforts on safety and health. Given the unique conditions of life inside a prison campus, the Department of Corrections continues an extra cautious approach to reopening. I am writing you today with an update on the Prison Pet Partnership, so you will share in our understanding, our planning work, and also join us in preparing for the future.</p>

        <h4>Welcome Meg</h4>
        <p>After a meticulous search, I am pleased to announce that Meg Quinlivan is PPP’s new Executive Director.</p>
        <p>The board and I chose Meg because of her expertise in executive leadership of organizations related to PPP’s mission. Most recently, Meg served as Executive Director for YWCA Kitsap County overseeing every aspect of the organization helping domestic violence survivors. Meg brings with her an impressive track record of turn-around and growth. We look forward to an exciting future under her leadership.</p>
        

        <p>As Meg shared, “I’m excited for the opportunity to serve PPP, a highly respected organization that plays such an important role in serving program participants, the animals, and ultimately our greater community. I look forward to how we will refocus and revitalize core programming while remaining mission-centered.”</p> 

        <p>In the coming days, we’ll share opportunities to welcome Meg to the community. I know she is certainly looking forward to meeting you. She can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:meg@prisonpetparntership.org">meg@prisonpetparntership.org</a>.</p>

        <h4>Thank YOU</h4>
        <p>My sincere thanks goes to PPP’s board of directors, organizational consultants, staff and our program participants. They worked hard to adapt our programs during COVID. I also thank our volunteers who fostered our beloved dogs over the past year and a half with compassion, dignity and respect.</p>

        <p>A special thank you also goes to all involved in the hiring process — board, program participants, our alumnae, volunteers and WCCW staff. Thanks for your countless hours to support a thorough search.</p>  

        <h4>Our Way Forward</h4>
        <p>Meg’s arrival marks a new and compelling chapter for us. The hiring of a new Executive Director comes at the perfect time as we will soon develop a plan to get back to life as we knew it, pre-COVID. I look forward to each and every one of YOU being a part of it. But for now, it’s time to celebrate! </p>

        <p>Happy summer everyone, </p>

        <h5>Boarding & Grooming Services Update</h5>
        <p>Our public boarding  and grooming facility will remain closed until further notice. We do not expect to reopen until late 2021 at the earliest. We are not taking any reservations or processing new pets. We will be sure to update you here as soon as anything changes with the Department of Corrections.</p>
        <h5>Service Dog Application Update</h5>
        <p>While our Service Dog Program is still running, we are no longer accepting new applicants, so that we can best serve our current waiting list. Our applications will not reopen until 2022 at the earliest.</p>
        <h5>Contacting Staff</h5>
        <p>To reach staff, please email <a href="mailto:info@prisonpetpartnership.org">info@prisonpetpartnership.org</a>. See our <a href="html/covid.html">COVID-19 page</a> for the most up-to-date info.</p>

        <p><strong>Prison Pet Partnership</strong> is a non-profit organization located on the grounds of the Washington Corrections Center for Women in Gig Harbor. PPP trains rescue and purpose-bred dogs as service, therapy and companion animals and operates a boarding and grooming facility to provide vocational education for individuals experiencing incarceration in Washington State. Our program benefits all involved — the animals who are given the chance to lead lives of service, the incarcerated and system impacted people who learn valuable skills so they may find gainful employment upon release, and the individuals with disabilities who receive well-trained dogs to help increase their level of independence.</p>
